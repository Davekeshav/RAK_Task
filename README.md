1) On this project I've developed the APIs to perform the CRUD Operation using Episerver IContentRepository API.
2) We have also installed the Content Delievery API to get requests and perform headless approach, as we know the Content Delievery API can only used to read the data (GET) request.
3) You can access the swagger to check the API methods (createArticle, getArticle, updateArticle and deleteArticle).
4) You can also use the Postman to call the API methods (createArticle, getArticle, updateArticle and deleteArticle).
5) Writen and Excute the Unit test for CRUD APIs method.
6) To open CMS and validate the Article Page you can use username as "keshav" and password as "Davekeshav4you@".
7) Make sure your system supports the correct .Net version to perform the project as expected.
