1) On this project I've developed the APIs to perform the CRUD Operation using Episerver Content Management API
2) We have also installed the Content Delievery API to get requests but the Content Delievery API can only used to read the data (GET) request.
3) I've also used the JWT Auth token to validate the HTTP request.
4) You can access the swagger to check the API class.
5) Writen and Excute the Unit for CRUD APIs method.
6) To open CMS and validate the Article Page you can use username as keshav and password as Davekeshav4you@
